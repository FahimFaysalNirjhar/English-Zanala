            1. What is the difference between var, let and const?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-sm">
            var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript, but
            they differ in how they behave. <br />
            <br />
            var is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible throughout the
            function in which it is declared. It allows redeclaration and
            reassignment, which can cause bugs and unexpected results, so it is
            not recommended in modern JavaScript. <br />
            <br />
            let is block-scoped, so it only exists within the block where it is
            declared. It cannot be redeclared in the same scope, but its value
            can be changed later. <br />
            <br />
            const is also block-scoped like let, but its value cannot be
            reassigned after declaration. It must be initialized at the time of
            declaration, although the contents of an object or array stored in a
            const variable can still be modified.

            <br />
            <br />
            map(), forEach(), and filter() are array methods in JavaScript used
            to process elements of an array, but they serve different purposes.
            <br />
            <br />
            map() is used to transform each element of an array and return a new
            array containing the modified values. It does not change the
            original array and always returns an array of the same length.
            <br />
            <br />
            forEach() is used to execute a function on each element of an array,
            but it does not return a new array. It is mainly used for performing
            actions such as logging values, updating the UI, or modifying
            external variables. <br />
            <br />
            filter() is used to select elements from an array that satisfy a
            specific condition and return a new array containing only the
            elements that match the condition. The length of the returned array
            may be smaller than the original.

            3. What are arrow functions and how are they different from regular
            functions?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-sm">
            Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions in
            JavaScript. They were introduced in ES6 to make function expressions
            more concise and easier to read, especially for small functions.
            <br />
            <br />
            The main difference between arrow functions and regular functions is
            how they handle the this keyword. Arrow functions do not have their
            own this; instead, they inherit this from the surrounding scope.
            Regular functions have their own this, which depends on how the
            function is called.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another difference is that arrow functions cannot be used as
            constructors and cannot be called with the new keyword, whereas
            regular functions can be used to create objects.
            <br /><br />
            Arrow functions also do not have their own arguments object, while
            regular functions do.
            <br />
            <br />
            In summary, arrow functions provide a cleaner syntax and lexically
            bind this, making them especially useful in callbacks and situations
            where you want to preserve the surrounding this context.

            4. How JavaScript Promises Work?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-sm">
            A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual
            result of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to write
            asynchronous code in a more structured and readable way, instead of
            deeply nested callbacks.
            <br />
            <br />
            A Promise can be in one of three states:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Pending – The operation has not completed yet. <br />
            2. Fulfilled (Resolved) – The operation completed successfully, and
            the promise has a value. <br />
            3. Rejected – The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for
            the failure (an error). <br /><br />
            You create a promise using the Promise constructor, which takes a
            function with two parameters: resolve and reject. <br />
            <br />
            * resolve(value) is called when the operation succeeds. <br />
            * reject(error) is called when the operation fails. <br />
            <br />
            You handle promises using the .then() method for successful results,
            .catch() for errors, and .finally() for code that should run in
            either case. Promises can also be chained, allowing multiple
            asynchronous operations to be performed in order without creating
            “callback hell.”

            5. How Closures Work in JavaScript?
          </div>
          <div class="collapse-content text-sm">
            A closure is a function that remembers and has access to variables
            from the scope in which it was created, even after that outer
            function has finished executing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Closures allow a function to “close over” its environment, which
            means it can access variables from its parent scope, even if the
            parent function has already returned. This is possible because in
            JavaScript, functions are first-class objects and retain a reference
            to their lexical environment.
            <br />
            <br />
            Closures are commonly used to: <br />
            <br />
            * Create private variables that cannot be accessed from outside the
            function. <br />
            * Maintain state between function calls. <br />
            * Implement
